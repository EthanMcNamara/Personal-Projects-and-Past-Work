# University Projects
Included here are a handful of projects I completed as part of my education at The University of Leeds.

## 3rd Year
### Individual Project - Visualisation of Your Favourite Algorithm
This was my major project during my final year at Unversity. The goal of the project was to create a plugin for an existing graph software that would be used as a learning tool for future students - allowing them to better visualise and break down graph and tree algorithms, as well as providing the framework for them to develop their own visualisations for algorithms not included.\
Further instructions on how to build and run the program are included within its respective folder.

### Web Services and Web Data - 'Flight Pirates' Airline Aggregator
This program was created as part of a larger group project within the Web Services and Web Data module. The program is a Command Line Interface that simulates Flight Aggregator sites such a Booking.com by communicating with APIs developed by other members of the group.\
Unfortunately the APIs that were used are no longer available, so the program does not fully function as intended.

## 2nd Year
### Compiler Design and Construction - Jack Compiler
This program was created as the main assessment for a module built around creating a simple compiler. The program compiles Jack code - a simple language from the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project.
